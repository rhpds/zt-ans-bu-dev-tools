_A guide to using the Ansible extension for Visual Studio Code to scaffold a new Ansible collection and playbook project._

---

== Lab Briefing

In this exercise, you will create an Ansible collection and a playbook using the Ansible extension's wizard in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

== Lab Guide: Hands-On Tasks

Welcome to this hands-on introduction to Ansible Development Tools (ADT). You will learn how to create, test, and deploy an Ansible collection using the `ansible-creator` tool through the Ansible extension for VS Code.

For this lab, all necessary tools and dependencies are pre-installed and configured for you.

=== Task 1: Explore the Ansible Extension

First, let's explore the Ansible extension for VS Code.

.   **Check the installed extensions section in VS Code**, look for the Ansible extension and click the blue **Reload Window** button to update to the latest version.

.   After the window reloads, locate and open the **Ansible extension icon on the sidebar of VS Code** and click on it. You will see the Ansible sidebar with three sections: (1) *Ansible Development Tools*, (2) *Ansible Lightspeed*, and (3) *Ansible Lightspeed Feedback*.

.   **Collapse the Lightspeed sections** to simplify the view, as we won't be using Lightspeed features for this lab.

=== Task 2: Create a Collection Project

Next, you will scaffold a new Ansible collection.

.   **Open the Collection project creator** by clicking the **Collection project** link in the *Ansible Development Tools* section.

.   **Fill out the collection details** in the new tab that opens. Use the following information:
* **Namespace:** `mynamespace`
* **Collection:** `mycollection`
* **Init path:** `/home/rhel/myansibleproject/collections/ansible_collections/mynamespace/mycollection`
* **Check** the box for `Install collection from source code (editable mode)`
+

* **Create the collection** by clicking the blue **Create** button. 
* After a few moments, you should see the creation details appear in the *Logs* box.

=== Task 3: Create a Playbook Project

Now, you will create a separate playbook project.

.   **Open the Playbook project creator** by clicking the **Playbook project** link in the Ansible extension sidebar.
+

.   **Fill out the playbook project details** in the new tab. Use the following information:
* **Destination directory:** `/home/rhel/myansibleproject`
* **Namespace:** `mynamespace`
* **Collection:** `mysecondcollection`
+

.   **Create the project** by clicking the **Create** button. After a couple of seconds, you should see a success message in the logs.

--- ansible-creator logs ---
Note: playbook project created at /home/rhel/myansibleproject

=== Task 4: Open the Collection Folder

Due to a lab infrastructure limitation, you will now manually open the folder where your new collection content was created.

.   **Open the file Explorer** by clicking the Explorer icon (the icon with two files) in the VS Code left sidebar.
+

.   **Open the collection folder** by clicking the **(1) Open Folder** button. In the path field, paste the following path **(2)** and click the blue **OK** button **(3)**.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]

/home/rhel/myansibleproject/collections/ansible_collections/mynamespace/mycollection/

.   **View the scaffolded files** once the VS Code screen reloads. You will see the complete directory structure and all the files created by the Ansible extension for your new collection in the left sidebar.
