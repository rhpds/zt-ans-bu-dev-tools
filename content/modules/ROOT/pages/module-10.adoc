== Review of learned concepts

You have reached the end of the *Introduction to Ansible development tools* workshop. In this lab, you learned about and used some of the most important tools available to Ansible developers:

* The **Ansible extension for VS Code** for a rich editing experience.
* **`ansible-creator`** to scaffold new collections and content.
* **`adt`** (Ansible development tools) for a unified command-line tools management.
* **`ade`** (Ansible development environment) for managing collection dependencies.
* **`ansible-lint`** for checking playbooks against best practices.
* **`ansible-navigator`** for a powerful terminal-based user interface to run and test your execution environments.
* **Ansible Molecule** for robustly testing your collections.

---

== Call to action: Run `ansible-dev-tools` on your own workstation!

If you would like to get all of these tools running on your own Windows, macOS, or Linux machine, check out the following interactive guide. It will walk you through setting up a VS Code Dev Container, which is a great way to get a consistent and isolated development environment in any OS.
