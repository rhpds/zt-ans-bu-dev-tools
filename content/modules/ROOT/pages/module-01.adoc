== Workshop Overview

Welcome to the Ansible development tools workshop!

In this lab, you will learn how to create, test, and deploy an Ansible collection using the Ansible development tools, including `ansible-creator`, `ansible-lint`, `ansible-navigator`, `molecule`, `ansible-builder`, the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor and the official Ansible extension.

== Lab Tips


Before we begin, here are some basic tips to improve your lab experience:

.   The **instructions sidebar** (where you are reading this) can be resized by dragging its border. This is useful if you need extra space for the main panel.

.   If you receive any VS Code notification pop-ups, you can safely ignore and dismiss them by clicking `x`, `Dismiss`, or `Ignore`, unless otherwise noted.

.   Now let's reload the **VS Code extensions** view to make sure we have the latest versions running. Inside the VS Code view, on the left icon sidebar, click the **Extensions** then click the **Reload Window** button in the **Ansible extension**

.   The lab consists of several **Chapters** (or sections). Each chapter contains one or more **Tasks**.

.   When you finish a **Chapter**, you must click the **Next** button at the bottom of the instructions sidebar to proceed. 

.   You can now click **Next** to continue!
